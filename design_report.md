This Employee Management System that I created is a simple Python program that lets you manage a list of employees and their salaries using a text file for storage. To run it and use the program, you have to make sure Python is installed on your computer, place all the project files in the same folder, open a terminal like github/VS code in that folder, and run python employee_system.py. When the program starts, you’ll see a numbered menu. Each number performs a different action. Option 1 shows you all employees currently stored in employees.txt along with their salaries. Option 2 lets you add a new employee by typing their name and salary. Option 3 lets you update the salary of an existing employee. Option 4 allows you to give someone a bonus, which gets added directly on top of their current salary. Option 5 prints a payroll report listing all employees and their salaries, as well as the total payroll amount for everyone combined. Option 6 deletes an employee completely from the file. Option 7 allows you to search for a name and see their salary if they exist. Option 8 shows statistics such as how many employees there are, the average salary, the total payroll, and who is the highest- and lowest-paid employee. Option 9 exits the program. All employee information is stored in the employees.txt file in the format name,salary, for example: ahmad,1000.0. The system reads and rewrites the file for most operations, and since it uses simple text storage, all changes are saved permanently even after the program closes. It is important that salaries and bonuses are entered as numbers only, because entering letters or symbols will cause the program to crash since input validation is not fully implemented. You also created both automated and manual tests for the program. The automated tests, written using pytest, cover adding employees, updating salaries, applying bonuses, deleting names, searching, calculating averages, totals, and checking highest and lowest salaries. These tests also include edge cases such as empty files and zero salaries to make sure the program behaves safely. Running pytest in the terminal will execute all tests at once. You also wrote a manual test plan that walks through the program step by step—testing each menu option, trying valid and invalid inputs, confirming data saves correctly, and restarting the program to check persistence. Together, the automated and manual testing ensure the system works as expected.
