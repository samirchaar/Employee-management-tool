This is a simple manual testing plan for trying the program from a user’s perspective. Start the program by running python employee_system.py, then follow the steps below.

Confirm that the menu displays the welcome message and all numbered options correctly.

Choose Option 1 when the file is empty to see how the program handles an empty list.

Use Option 2 to add a new employee (name and salary), then return to Option 1 to verify that the entry appears.

Add a second employee and test the remaining features:

Option 3: Update an employee’s salary

Option 4: Apply a bonus

Option 5: View the payroll report and total salary

Option 6: Delete an employee

Option 7: Search for an employee by name

Option 8: View statistics such as employee count and average salary

Finally, choose Option 9 to exit the program.

You should also test invalid input, such as typing a letter when a number is expected, to see how the program handles errors.
Close and reopen the program to confirm that all saved data persists correctly in employees.txt.
